# CulinaryShare

CulinaryShare is an online web application developed solely by NightwavesStudios. CulinaryShare was developed for the inovation project portion of the Atlanta Droids' (57000) FLL competition. The purpose of CulinaryShare is to provide people with cooking lessons, recipes, games, and more. Furthermore, CulinaryShare was developed as a replacement to other sites that may not fully focus on cooking, and may be unsafe for people.
